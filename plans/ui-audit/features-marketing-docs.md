# Marketing & Docs UI + i18n

Goal: AR/EN translations across marketing shell (header, footer, hero copy) and docs surfaces (search, results, content snippets).

## Steps
- [x] Inventory marketing components (site-header, site-footer, hero sections) and docs pages; note files.
- [x] Localize marketing and docs copy in EN/AR; ensure `useTranslation` usage where applicable.
- [x] Confirm docs search/results UI wiring and empty states are localized and functional.
- [x] UX polish: AR direction, nav alignment, focus states for search inputs.
- [x] Manual smoke: browse marketing pages and docs in EN/AR; verify layout and copy; log findings.
