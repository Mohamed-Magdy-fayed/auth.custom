# Pricing & Checkout UI + i18n

Goal: AR/EN translations and correct UX for pricing cards and checkout CTA (Stripe currently stubbed).

## Steps
- [x] Inventory pricing page components/cards and checkout buttons; note files.
- [x] Localize pricing copy, badges, CTAs, and fallback notices (EN/AR).
- [x] Confirm Stripe stubs return types align with UI expectations; ensure checkout buttons handle disabled/stub mode gracefully with localized messaging.
- [x] UX polish: loading states for Suspense, AR direction, consistent button variants.
- [x] Manual smoke: load pricing in EN/AR, verify fallback/demo messaging; mark findings.
